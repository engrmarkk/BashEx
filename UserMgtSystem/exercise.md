### **Project Title**: **"User Management System"**

---

### **Objective**:
Create a Bash script to manage users on a Linux system. This will involve creating, deleting, and modifying user accounts, managing groups, and displaying user information.

---

### **Steps and Guide**:

#### **1. Initialize the Script**:
- Start by creating a script file (e.g., `user_management.sh`).
- Add a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) at the top.

---

#### **2. Display a Menu**:
- Create a menu with options such as:
  - Add a new user.
  - Delete an existing user.
  - Modify user details.
  - Add a user to a group.
  - View user information.
  - Exit the script.

---

#### **3. Validate User Permissions**:
- Check if the script is being run with `sudo` or as the root user.
- Display an error message if the script lacks sufficient privileges.

---

#### **4. Implement Add User**:
- Prompt for a username and (optionally) a home directory.
- Create a new user using the `useradd` command.
- Optionally, set a password for the user using `passwd`.

---

#### **5. Implement Delete User**:
- Prompt for the username to delete.
- Use the `userdel` command to remove the user.
- Ask if the home directory should also be deleted.

---

#### **6. Modify User Details**:
- Allow updating details such as:
  - Change the user's home directory.
  - Change the user's login shell.
  - Lock or unlock the user's account.

---

#### **7. Add User to Group**:
- Prompt for a username and a group name.
- Use the `usermod -aG` command to add the user to the group.
- Display a list of groups to the user to choose from.

---

#### **8. Display User Information**:
- Prompt for a username to display their details.
- Use commands like `id`, `groups`, and `finger` to display information.

---

#### **9. Error Handling**:
- Check if the provided username exists before performing any action.
- Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or failed commands.

---

#### **10. Loop Until Exit**:
- Use a loop to keep showing the menu until the user chooses the "Exit" option.

---

### **Bonus Features**:
- Add logging to record all actions performed by the script.
- Implement a "Search for User" option to check if a username exists.
- Allow batch user creation from a file containing usernames.
